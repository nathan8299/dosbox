VNC Server
by Tai Chi Minh Ralph Eastwood

This requires libvncserver to function.
Initial version adds two configuration variables in the dosbox config;
these are: 'vnc' and 'vncport'.
The former enables the vnc server if true, whereas vncport starts listening on
the specified port.

TODO
Add output interface for VNC, as well as input
Sound via VNC extension?
